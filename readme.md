# United States Population Estimate: 2023
## This map shows a map of the United States and a state-by-state break down of Where the People Are for the year 2023.
I am a student at App State and I created this map for a class project. I am majoring in Environmental Biology, and my coursework focuses on the environment and our impact on it. I think it is important to emphasize the rapid growth of our country's population, especially over the past few years.
