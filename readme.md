# United States Population Estimate: 2023
## This map shows a map of the United States and a state-by-state break down of Where the People Are for the year 2023.
I am a student at App State and I created this map for a class project. I am majoring in Environmental Biology, and my coursework focuses on the environment and our impact on it. I think it is important to emphasize the rapid growth of our country's population, especially over the past few years. 
- The base map was loaded from GeoJSON.
- The route was generated using GeoJSON and Leaflet.

I downloaded this data from the U.S. Census Bureau official website to ensure that it is accurate. Because it is from 2023, it is the most updated census data that we have for the U.S. and is therefore the most accurate to the current population.

I chose to do a proportional symbol map to represent this data because I believe it has the greatest visual impact for the user to understand the scale of the population by state. I chose a sage green/orange color palette simply because I thought the two colors meshed well, and chose a red color as the user clicks on each separate point because red is typically an alarming color.
